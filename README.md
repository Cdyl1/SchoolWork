**Lab 7** just shows a cube spinning in place with blocks below it. There is also a red rectangle that resembles a character.

**Lab 6** prints and makes rectangles with an array at it's core.

**Lab 5** is a color lazy color changer. The left square sets the five rectangles to a set color and the right circle sets the 
colors to something different. The fun twist is pressing a button on the left side causes the color to doubles its value and 
the right divides the color value.
